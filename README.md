# Image/Heat Map Maker

This repository contains a script or two for creating heat maps from
Zooniverse-style image (subject) annotations that can be superimposed on
the original image.

To run the script:

```bash
$ python make_image_heatmap.py
```

To view the output:

```bash
$ ristretto ./. &
```

Enjoy!
